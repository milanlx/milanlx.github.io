* *On The Equivalence Between AUC and Contrastive Loss*: TBD

* *Comparing MPC and PID controllers*: a simple case. \
There is a trend that some of the PID controllers are being replaced by more advanced one, i.e., Model predictive controller (MPC). However, in what aspects that MPC would make improvement is not theoretically clear. As a starting point, the following [dicussion](https://milanlx.github.io/files/LQR_PID.pdf) aims to reveal the difference between the two controllers on first order systems.  Follow-up: convert MPC (linear-quadratic) as SP/SQP optimization problem ([link](https://milanlx.github.io/files/mpc_to_qp_sqp.pdf)).
