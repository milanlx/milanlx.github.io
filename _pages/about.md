I am an Applied Scientist at Amazon and went to graduate school at Carnegie Mellon University, with a M.S. in Machine Learning (2020). I am interested in multimodal and reinforcement learning, and also have expertise in graph neural networks, diffusion model and optimal control. My research intuitions are mainly inspired from interdisciplinary analogy, and some of my thoughts are outlined in those [blogs](https://milanlx.github.io/blog/).

Besides research, I am fan of soccer, tennis, investment and philosophy. My home teams are **<span style="color: red"> AC </span> Milan**
 and [Dalian Pro FC](http://www.dlpro.com.cn/), and favourite writers are *Milan Kundera* and *J. D. Salinger*.

I am a PhD student in the [Civil Engineering Department](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), advised by [Pine Liu](https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/liu/) and [Sean Qian](https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/qian/). A short version of my resume could be found [here](https://milanlx.github.io/files/work_resume.pdf) .

**Research Interest**: 
graph neural networks; stochastic control; tabular embedding; diffusion model; spatiotemporal & multimodal analysis; model predictive control

My current research focuses on implementing generalizable Model Predictive Control policies that can be integrated with existing building HVAC control frameworks, and spatial-temporal graph neural networks to infer interactions in urban systems such as building and transportation. Before coming to CMU, I obtained M.S. in Structural Engineering, and B.S in Civil Engineering, both from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), fortunated to have been supervised by [Jinping Ou](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/oujinping) and worked on [optimal sensor placement of deepwater risers](https://milanlx.github.io/files/Master%20Dissertation%20(original).pdf) ([slides](https://milanlx.github.io/files/mastet_thesis_short_version.pdf)). I also obtained a M.S. in Machine Learning at CMU on 2020.
