I am a PhD student in the [Civil Engineering Department](https://www.cmu.edu/cee/) at [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu), advised by [Pine Liu](https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/liu/) and [Sean Qian](https://faculty.ce.cmu.edu/qian/). A short version of my resume could be found [here](https://milanlx.github.io/files/xuanli_job_Jun_2021.pdf) .

**Research Interest**
Graph Neural Networks; Generalizable Model Predictive Control; Spatial-temporal Modeling of Interdependent Urban Systems; Stochastic Control

My current research focuses on implementing generalizable Model Predictive Control policies that can be integrated with existing building HVAC control frameworks, and spatial-temporal graph neural networks to infer interactions in urban systems such as building and transportation. Before coming to CMU, I obtained M.S. in Structural Engineering, and B.S in Civil Engineering, both from [Dalian University of Technology](https://en.dlut.edu.cn/), fortunated to have been supervised by [Jinping Ou](http://homepage.hit.edu.cn/oujinping) and worked on [optimal sensor placement of deepwater risers](https://milanlx.github.io/files/Master%20Dissertation%20(original).pdf) ([slides](https://milanlx.github.io/files/mastet_thesis_short_version.pdf)). I also obtained a M.S. in Machine Learning at CMU on 2020. 

Besides research, I am fan of soccer, tennis, investment and philosophy. My favourite teams are **<span style="color: red"> AC </span> Milan**
 and [Dalian Pro FC](http://www.dlpro.com.cn/), and favourite writers are *Milan Kundera* and *J. D. Salinger*.
