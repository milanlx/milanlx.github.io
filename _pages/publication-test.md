Machine Learning Track 
--------------
* Tree-Regularized Tabular Embeddings, *NeurIPS Workshop*, 2023. [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00963), [poster](https://milanlx.github.io/files/tree-regularized-embedding-poster.pdf), [code](https://github.com/milanlx/tree-regularized-embedding)

* Meta and Contrastive Learning Improves Tabular AUC with Unlabeled Data, *Amazon Machine Learning Conference (AMLC)*, 2022
  * <font size=3> justified the effectiveness and generalizability of semi-supervised and self-supervised framework on two tabular application in Amazon. The proposed methods outperform production models. </font> 
  * <font size=3> unprecedentedly bridged the gap between maximizing AUC and minimizing contrastive loss (CL) with empirical and theoretical proofs. Intuitively, it explains that CL can be regarded as surrogate when targetting towards AUC maximization. </font>
